## Python
### Python version
During the development of these solution, I used python version 3.9 but any version over 3.6 should work.
### Run examples
To run the examples, you will need to go into the specific directory of the example and run the command `python main.py`. This should run the challenge python file.

## Rust
### Install Rust and Cargo
This simple one liner will install all of the necesary library and development tool.

```curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh```

### Run examples
To run the examples, you will need to go into the specific directory and run the command `cargo run`. This should build and run the specific example in Rust.
